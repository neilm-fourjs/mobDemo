# GBC Mobile Customisation

The goal of this theme was for a very clean look that's more spaced out than the default.
It's intended for running GMA using UR.

It uses very few javascript and scss overrides, the bulk of the styling is done in the theme.scss.json file.

NOTE: The GBC customization was done using the 1.00.58 release.
